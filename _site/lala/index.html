<p>We present here an exploratory analysis of the full dataset. The workflow we try
to follow in this study is the one suggested in this <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6228/1314.full">useful
paper</a>.</p>

<p>For more details about how the analysis is done, please refer to this <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ggrrll/hop_suisse_ada_project_public/blob/master/6-data_analysis/exploratory_full_sport_dataset.ipynb">Jupyter

<h3 id="an-overview-in-video">An overview in video</h3>

<p>We first try to give an overwiew of the data in video, following the approach of
this great example : <a href="https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo">200 Countries, 200 Years, 4
Minutes</a>. Here, we use the format to display
jointly :</p>

<ul>
  <li>the pace (on the Y axis),</li>
  <li>the experience of the runners (<em>ie.</em> whether they are beginners or experts, on
the X axis),</li>
  <li>different races and their number of competitors (dots and their size),</li>
  <li>the runners sex (with colors),</li>
  <li>the runners age.</li>
</ul>

<p>Conclusions on this video:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Young runners run on shorter distances;</li>
  <li>Men pace is always a bit lower than women pace;</li>
  <li>Pace is higher for very young and old runners, with a minimum around 20 years old;</li>
  <li>There are lots of new young runners (&lt;12 years old) for low distance races, but most of the
new runners are between 15 and 25 years old.</li>
  <li>The number of new runners decreases with the age, together with the total number of runners
of a certain age.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="note-on-unique-runners">Note on unique runners</h2>

<p>Given the significant size of the dataset, we encountered some difficulties when
trying to distinguish runners according to their attributes, given that names
are not unique.</p>

<p>Checking the demographics of a few races, we could notice that there were even
some namesakes born the same year but with different residence cities. At first
glance this combination (name, birthyear and residence city) could have been
used to determine unique runners, <em>however</em> this does not necessarily works :
some people might just change residence during their running career (indeed we
can find that by cross-checking our dataset with other resources on the web) and
be idientified as two different people.</p>

<p>We have therefore decided to stick to a simple rule and to distinguish runners
based on their <em>name</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>birthyear</em> combination.</p>

<h2 id="statistics-across-time">Statistics across time</h2>

<h3 id="number-of-runners-across-time-by-sex">Number of runners across time, by sex</h3>

<p>The following graph shows the number of runners across time separated
by sex.</p>

<div id="runners-count-sex"></div>

<p>We can observe a clear <em>increase</em> in time of the number of participants
in the races, for both sex, across all Switzerland.</p>

<h3 id="number-of-runners-across-time-by-distance">Number of runners across time, by distance</h3>

<p>The following graph shows the number of runners across time separated
by distances of the races. We only consider the most relevant distances,
that is the ones with a larger number of runners.</p>

<div id="runners-count-distance"></div>

<p>Interestingly in the last 3 years, in terms of number of runners, it
seems to have been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an <em>increase</em> for the 10 km;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quite a <em>stable</em> situation for the half-marathon;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <em>decrease</em> for the marathon.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="distribution-of-the-number-of-editions-per-race">Distribution of the number of editions per race</h3>

<p>The following graph shows the number of races with respect to the
number of times these races took place.</p>

<div id="editions-distribution"></div>

<p>Consequently, most races have been organized at most twice. The most
frequent race in history is Chäsitzerlouf - Kehrsatz, which has been
organized 16 times. Right after, with 15 editions, come 20km de Lausanne,
Basler Stadtlauf, Frauenfelder, Gurtenclassic - Wabern, Kerzerslauf, and
Schweizer Frauenlauf Bern.</p>

<h3 id="age-across-editions">Age across editions</h3>

<p>For this study we use the first 20 races with the largest number of
runners.</p>

<p>Select a race: <select id="race" onchange="drawAgesAcrossEditions();"></select></p>
<div id="age-popular-races"></div>

<p>After performing an
<a href="http://vsp.pnnl.gov/help/Vsample/Design_Trend_Mann_Kendall.htm">Mann-Kendall</a>
test (with p-value threshold at 0.05), we conclude that for many of the races analysed, it is not possible to
claim a global trend for the runners’ mean age, across time. The test is
affected by the lack of data points. We have however also obtained some
significant results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there is an <em>increase</em> of the runner’s mean age for ASICS Bremgarter
Reusslauf, Jungfrau-Marathon and Kerzerslauf;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is a <em>decrease</em> of the runner’s mean age for 20km de Lausanne,
Course de l’Escalade, Hallwilerseelauf, Luzerner Stadtlauf,
Morat-Fribourg, Thuner Stadtlauf and Zürcher Silvesterlauf.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="statistics-on-performance-vs-age">Statistics on performance <em>vs</em> age</h2>

<p>Note that we only consider races with the higher number of runners, and
categories with standard running distances: 10km, 20km/half marathon
and full marathon.</p>

<p>We will see that a U-shape is observed for the most popular events,
especially when enough data is available. This shape becomes more
visible with longer distances (full marathon), while it somehow fades
out for shorter distances, like 10 km.</p>

<h3 id="marathon">Marathon</h3>

<p>The following graph represents the median time the runners took to finish
a full marathon with respect to the age of the runner, for different
races.</p>

<p>Select a race: <select id="race-42km" onchange="drawTimeWrtAge(&quot;42km&quot;);"></select></p>
<div id="timevsage-42km"></div>

<h3 id="half-marathon--20km">Half marathon / 20km</h3>

<p>The following graph represents the median time the runners took to finish
a half marathon with respect to the age of the runner, for different
races.</p>

<p>Select a race: <select id="race-21km" onchange="drawTimeWrtAge('21km');"></select></p>
<div id="timevsage-21km"></div>

<h3 id="10km">10km</h3>
<p>The following graph represents the median time the runners took to finish
a 10km race with respect to the age of the runner, for different races.</p>

<p>Select a race: <select id="race-10km" onchange="drawTimeWrtAge('10km');"></select></p>
