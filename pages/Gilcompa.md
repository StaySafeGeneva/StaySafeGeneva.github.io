## When does the accidents happen?
All the news evoque to an increase of accidents during last years. The evolution of number of accidents from 2010 to 2016 in Geneva shows that from 2012 to 2014 there has been a **strong increase**, however it has been stabilized during the last two years.

The **months of the year with more accidents** are March, June, September and October. This coincide with the holidays start or the holidays ending. It can also be observed that in average, there are **more accidents at the end of the year**.

But when is the day of the week with more number of accidents in average? From Monday to Thursday we observe that there is the same amount of accidents in average. Let's check which day of the week there are more accidents:

> ### **Be careful** on Friday!
## Is there the same risk during the morning and the evening?
It is known that the traffic is more dense in the morning or in the afternoon, when people go or come back home. We observe that it also correlated with the number of accidents.
