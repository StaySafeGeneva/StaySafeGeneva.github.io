Road safety has always a been a first in the list matter for administration. An exploratory analysis has been done in order to understnad better the accidents in Geneva. A general approach to get an overview is two ask ourselves the following questions:
* **When** are the accidents happen?

* **How** they arise and why?

* **What** are the consequences of these accidents?

* **Who** are the people and vehicles involved?

## When?
