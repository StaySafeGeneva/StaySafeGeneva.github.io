Road safety has always been an important matter for public administration. In particular, traffic accidents have increased during last years in Switzerland ([link](http://lenews.ch/2017/06/23/swiss-traffic-worse-in-2016-especially-in-lausanne/)). Nowadays, it is available traffic accidents data of the Geneva region.

> So why not use this data to sensibilize the citizens and help the administration to apply more detailed preventive measures?

Our purpose of this project is to understand better the Geneva accidents in order to provide in the future, **real-time locally preventive measures** in form of digital panels advice, sporadic police controls or giving input information to the future self-driving cars.


In a more digitalized world, there will be more and more cities providing complete and rich information about the road traffic data. Furthermore, the work done by the authors could be sclaed in other cities.  


## Structure:

This website is devide in four sections:
1. [Getting started](pages/Gilcompa) where a general overview is provided.
2. [A visual story](/pages/Milani) is developped to analyse some particular cases.
3. [The risk calculator](/pages/risk_calculator), a quick tool to compute the risk associated to roads in Geneva
4. [Safety maps](/pages/safety_map) proof of concept of how we could apply the computed risk per road to directions applications (e.g. SBB/CFF or Google Maps)
