Road safety has always an important matter for public administration. In particular, traffic accidents have increased during last years in Switzerland ([link](http://lenews.ch/2017/06/23/swiss-traffic-worse-in-2016-especially-in-lausanne/)). Nowadays, it is available traffic accidents data of the Geneva region. 

> So why not use this data to sensibilize the citizens and help the administration to apply more detailed preventive measures? 

Our purpose of this project is to understand better the Geneva accidents in order to provide in the future, **real-time locally preventive measures** in form of digital panels advice, sporadic police controls or giving input information to the future self-driving cars. 


In a more digitalized world, there will be more and more cities providing complete and rich information about the road traffic data. Furthermore, the work done by the authors could be sclaed in other cities.  


## Structure:

This website is devide in four sections:
1. [Getting started](pages/Gilcompa) where a general overview is provided.
2. [A visual story](/pages/Milani) is developped to analyse some particular cases.
3. [The risk calculator](/pages/risk_calculator) 
4. [Safety maps](/pages/safety_map) proof of concept

## Content

#### 1.The aim of the first part is to have a geographical understanding of the data.
* For the citizen it may give the places to avoid or in which he should pay additional attention
* For the authorities it may give an idea of the places where they should make an intervention to prevent further disasters


#### 2. How to interpret the accidents?
Beginning with a general overview we will try to get in depth and find the most important factors of accidents. Even though it is specific to Geneva the results found here should be applicable in all kind of similar city. Again, we think that it is only by understanding the dynamics of the accidents that we can take measures to avoid them.
This part is composed by several subparts:
* Exposition of trends of accidents
* Causes
* Consequences

#### 3. The risk calculator

This last and smaller part is just to give you a taste of what can be then done. The working principle is that we compute a risk for each road with a given metric. We can then choose the safest route to travel from point **A** to point **B**. E.g. this could be used as an add-on to itinerary calculator applications for Google maps of the SBB/CFF application.
