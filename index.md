We feel the roads security is an important apsect of our lifes and thus wanted to do something in order to improve it! As a result we decided to make this project, hoping that we will sensibilize the citizen of Geneva and ,_why not_, also the authorities, so that in a near future our roads will be safer!

## Structure:

To present the results we divided the website into 4 smaller parts:
1. [Getting started](pages/Gilcompa)
2. [A visual story](/pages/Milani)
3. [The risk calculator](/pages/risk_calculator)
4. [Safety maps](/pages/safety_map) proof of concept

If you wanna know more about this project, do not hesitate to visit the about page

## Content

#### 1.The aim of the first part is to have a geographical understanding of the data.
* For the citizen it may give the places to avoid or in which he should pay additional attention
* For the authorities it may give an idea of the places where they should make an intervention to prevent further disasters


#### 2. How to interpret the accidents?
Beginning with a general overview we will try to get in depth and find the most important factors of accidents. Even though it is specific to Geneva the results found here should be applicable in all kind of similar city. Again, we think that it is only by understanding the dynamics of the accidents that we can take measures to avoid them.
This part is composed by several subparts:
* Exposition of trends of accidents
* Causes
* Consequences

#### 3. The risk calculator

This last and smaller part is just to give you a taste of what can be then done. The working principle is that we compute a risk for each road with a given metric. We can then choose the safest route to travel from point **A** to point **B**. E.g. this could be used as an add-on to itinerary calculator applications for Google maps of the SBB/CFF application.
